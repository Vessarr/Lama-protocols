Sending files
  1. read bytes of file into 1000 character max blocks, into a data table.
  2. encode all control characters of each block except for NUL.
  3. encode NUL by matching all remaining control characters which should now only be NUL.
  4. encode all non standered characters.
  5. send file start tag to start client data capture with proper augments for if you want it to play the file or if its a pluggin or just a file.
  6. send each block of file with a 0.02 second delay between to ensure proper data capture.
  7. insert a newline in between each block if send function doesnt do it automaticly, to mark data blocks for client.
  8. send file end tag.
  9. (optional) keep record of files sent to ensure you dont resend the same midi/wav every time somone enters a sound point.

Sending plugin files
  1. read bytes of file into 1000 character blocks into a data table.
  2. encode all newlines and tabs.
  (optional) if pluggin contains a file end tag same as the end tag used by the lama file protocol pluggin it must be encoded or risks being removed.
  3. send file start tag to start client data capture.
  4. send each block of file with a 0.02 second delay between to ensure proper data capture.
  5. insert a newline inbetween each block to mark data blocks for client.
  6. send file end tag.

File start tag
  {file[client file location[name[file extension[to do}

  -client file location is the location that you want the file to go client side(be sure its a standard mushclient folder or make the folder before sending anything to it).
  -name is the name of the file being sent.
  -file extension is the extension of the file being send.
  -to do is what to do with the file when recived (y = mid or wav file, n = just a file do nothing, pl = pluggin file).

  Example : {file[world/plugin/[lama_file_protocol[.xml[pl}
  sending the lama file protocol plugin
  Example : {file[sounds/[nothing[.mid[y}
  sending the midi file nothing that will be played
  TIP:sending a midi file with nothing in it but the basic midi format data stops a currently playing midi file!

File end tag
  {/file}
